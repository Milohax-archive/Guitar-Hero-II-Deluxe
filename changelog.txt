                                 2.0 Changelog
===============================================================================

BUGFIXES
========
- Maximum amount of setlist entries bumped again, to roughly 200 entries
	- This does not mean 200 songs will necessarily fit on a disc! 4GB is
	still the maximum ARK size the game can recognize
	- If you manage to fit that many songs on a disc, however, they'll all
	appear on setlists now
- Lead/rhythm songs have been given a full remix to sound their absolute best
	- Rhythm songs now feature a unique singleplayer rhythm chart made from
	the unused (in normal singleplayer) parts of the lead and rhythm charts
	- Try "Last Child" if you're looking for a good one to get an idea of
	what I'm talking about
- The multiplier symbol in the score display now appears on emulator
- Camera will no longer switch in Focus Mode
	- Fixes the DOF effects randomly getting applied to the on-screen text
- Original-length tips have been restored
- The game's innards are now much, much cleaner
	- All unused scripts (over half of them) stripped out
	- Smaller scripts are consolidated into where they were merged in
- Bass and rhythm guitar will now use the animations set in those tracks
instead of using the guitar/lead guitar's animations
- L1+L2+Select on the controller in debug no longer crashes the game

ADDED FEATURES
==============
- Drums:
	- Drums are selectable as an instrument on 21 songs, all of which are
	available in the Deluxe: Expansion executable
		- Some of these are newly charted and mixed GH2 songs, while others
		are ports of Rock Band favorites
	- No Star Power for drums (as there are no fills like in Rock Band)
		- As such, no Star Power meter when playing drums
	- You'll need some way of mapping your drumkit to a DualShock's inputs,
	using PCSX2 or a custom pademu like only jnack currently has
	- Can be charted using the normal guitar pitches on the PART DRUM track
	- Our traditional channel mapping is stereo band on 0 and 1, mono guitar
	on 2, mono bass on 3, and stereo drums on 4 and 5
	- Drums are disabled in debug
		- Even though the retail executable handles them just fine, even on
		hardware, debug refuses to work with us on them /shrug
- Separate campaigns:
	- GH2, 80's, Mega, Expansion
	- 80's features all 80's venues and characters
	- Mega includes both GH2 and 80's songs for a total of 14 tiers
	- Expansion is a Free Play-only set of 21 songs picked for their drum
	charts, strum limit-testing guitar charts, and fun bass parts
		- Some songs are upgraded GH2 and 80's songs, others have been ported
		from Rock Band
	- These are selectable prior to game boot using a customized loader
		- This loader also enables debug GH2 and GH:80's to be used without
		having to rebuild the entire disc
	- All use their own saves, so no worries about corrupt saves here
		- Expansion does not save, as it's Custom Edition-based and features
		all songs unlocked at boot
- Combined note streak display/FC indicator
	- Text appears orange on FC runs and turns white on combo break
	- Works in all modes, including shared streak in co-op
- Newspaper gets real froggy on FC runs
	- "100% FC" note percentage (as opposed to "100%" on overstrum runs)
	- Stars turn into pentagrams because you need to be possessed in order to
	FC anything :marf:
- Bass, rhythm, and drums in Career
- Quit to Practice in the Pause menu
- Manage Gig menu in Free Play
	- This condenses the old Free Play flow of Difficulty > Character >
	Guitar > Venue into a single menu where any, all, or none of these can
	be changed before a song
	- Guitar, and venue will be greyed out when Focus Mode is
	active
- Extras menu in Manage Gig menu
	- Cheat codes are no longer functional (aside from Unlock All and
	Hyperspeed :tim:), and cheats are now set in the Extras menu
	- You can't trick the game into using conflicting cheats (say, Horse
	Head and Flaming Head), they'll unset one another
- Author names
	- Appear at the start of each song in the "MTV overlay"
	- Can be set for any custom by adding a "[shortname]_author" string to
	the locale files (a locale_authors.dta is provided for convenience)
	- Onyx will set one from available metadata if using that program
	- Author names do not appear in debug to prevent a potential crash if
	a song's author field is missing
- Streamer-friendly black highway
	- Enabled in the Extras menu
	- Replaces the fretboard backing with an off-black color, making keying
	out the background in Focus Mode using streaming software much easier
- "Cheater" callouts on the newspaper screen if using autoplay
- Select to restart Practice, like in Clone Hero
- Split and sorted locale files
	- The gigantic locale.dta in ui/eng/ has now been split into numerous
	locale files to make it easier to change specific strings
- Additional StrumMap and HandMap events available to charters
	- HandMaps:
		- Index, Middle, Ring, Pinky, and matching Index_Hi, Middle_Hi, etc.
		(forces certain fretting fingers down)
		- Octave and Octave2 (creates an octave shape on guitar)
	- StrumMaps:
		- Open (fingerstyle, but all strings open)
		- SlapBassOpen (slap technique, but all strings open)
		- Pick (allows bassists to pick, alongside fingerstyle and slap
		styles)
		- PickOpen (as above, but all strings open)
- New cheats (again, set in Extras Menu):
	- Roxbury Mode
	- No Fail
	- GRYBO (original order) smashers and gems

RESTORED AND PORTED CONTENT
===========================
- Pretty much the entirety of 80's is now in Deluxe...
	- "I Want Candy" restored from the 80's Deluge demo
	- "Ballroom Blitz" uses the much less unfair Deluge demo chart for Expert
	- "Bang Your Head (Metal Health)" features the cut solo and additional
	fixes in animations, lighting, and undercharting
	- "I Wanna Rock" ported from GH: Smash Hits to take advantage of its drum
	chart and lack of fadeout
	- "The Warrior" restored from the original multitracks to fix its fadeout
	- "Because, It's Midnite" purchasable in the store
- GH1 Redux:
	- GH1 menu music, many of the menus, flavor text
	- All GH1 characters now (mostly) work in GH2
	- Six GH1 songs have been brought over with bass charts and stems
	- GH1 Redux WILL NOT WORK on hardware; this demo is emulator-only
- GH3 main menu and menu music also ported, just because we can
	- How do you find it? I sure hope you were planning on egg hunting :tim:
- Remastered HUD to match and improve the 360 HUD
	- Notes shimmer, smashers have nice, big, detailed holes now
	- A seventh digit has been added to the score display
- Drum gems from the GH2 OPM demo are used for drums, including the kick bar
- Songs that later appeared in Rock Band backported for drum charts
	- "Collide", "War Pigs", "Possum Kingdom", "Less Talk More Rokk", "Push
	Push (Lady Lightning)", "I Ran (So Far Away)", "Electric Eye"
	- These have also received custom mixes and light shows to go with them
- Section names from all Rock Band titles
	- Except that one :marf:
	- Onyx ports from Rock Band games will now show proper sections names on
	the More Stats screen
- 80's and international cheats are now functional in Deluxe (yes, even if
they're cheats set on the Extras menu now)
	- This should help our Brazilian friends go egg hunting before they steal
	our GH3 menu from the game files :marf:

NEW CONTENT
===========
- Red Star Power
	- Because red Star Power
- Easier-to-distinguish HO/PO notes with full white tops

- A "speed metal" version of "Speed Test", accessible in GH:80's
	- Shoutout to HalfDuck for being a legend and providing stems
- A brand new bootloader and menu for selecting the various campaigns
	- For the curious: this menu is based off the Europe-only pack-in PS2
	demo disc, disc ID PBPX_95205
	- The loader has been patched to display on NTSC televisions and the
	normal left-right controls have been inverted to up-down so as to work
	with your guitars
		- You'll still need to use Blue to select things, however
	- Menu video and music have been switched out for a more custom finish
- Recolored menus just as quickly and lazily done as HMX's for 80's :steve:
- Redone intro video for 80's to match 2's
- Each campaign uses its own, custom-colored memory card save and icon

TWEAKS
======
- The demo loading screen has been reconfigured to display much longer tips
- Expert is now the default difficulty in the difficulty select menus
- Free Play defaults:
	- Axel Steel
	- Red SG
	- Warped Tour (which we've determined runs the best overall)
- Separate Practice audio has been removed and disabled

	you can slow the song down by 5% increments using the Song Speed modifier

		gameplay
	- This is mostly for space reasons
- Guitar tweaks:
	- Scythe is purchasable in the store and usable by anyone
	- Air Guitar (formerly a cheat) has been turned into an unlock
	- All lower difficulty unlock guitars (Fish, USA, Coffin, Viking,
	Eyeball, Snaketapus) are simply store guitars now

- Controller "quick cheats" in debug have been completely remapped
	- Some more temperamental functions are now keyboard-only
	- Some more fun keyboard-only functions can be done on controller too

after runs is skipped
