                                 Modding Guide
===============================================================================

One of the aims of Guitar Hero II Deluxe was to create a new, definitive base
for future modding projects on the GH2 version of the Milo engine. We've
already fielded questions about how to get custom charts and (more amusingly)
how to change the colors of the strikeline back. (It's a cheat now, lads! No
worries about editing your game files.)

This file aims to be a decent little explanation for common file formats and
tools you need to have for modding Deluxe. Choose your own adventure:

I JUST WANT TO PLAY CUSTOMS
===========================
If you're simply wanting to get Clone Hero songs into Deluxe, check
gh2-deluxe.neocities.org for Custom Edition, which is a minimalist base you
can use to put new songs into GH2 without worry about making sure the Career
works or anything.

You'll also want to grab the Onyx Music Game Toolkit, which can read in Clone
Hero-format songs (select the song.ini when loading a song!) and throw them
into a GH2 ARK, taking care of all the messy stuff for you with a nice GUI as
opposed to any Command Prompt junk. It can even batch convert songs!

Onyx can also import drums from Rock Band or Clone Hero format charts into
Deluxe 2.0, as well as the chart author names, which will appear at the start
of songs in every version of Deluxe except for the two debug executables
(to protect against them crashing for missing author names).

I WANT TO DO MORE THAN PLAY CUSTOMS
===================================
Let's talk toolchain then! To be clear, Guitar Hero Explorer (or GHEx) WILL
NOT WORK with GH2:DX. GHEx is old, busted, finicky, likely to crash, and
ridiculously picky with what what you put in it. The GH2:DX ARK will simply
be rejected if you try to load it into GHEx. As such, you'll have to upgrade
your tools if you'd like to play with our disc.

FILE FORMATS
============
Here's the big file formats you'll be working with and what they contain:

- File container: GH2 stores all of its files in an ARK container, which is a
  bit like a tarball and gets around the filename limitations on a DVD.
  You'll have to get inside it, either by way of an ARK disassembler like ARK
  Expander or ArkHelper or an ARK editor like ArkTool, to poke at the files.
  Once you get inside, just rip stuff out, replace it, and see what happens.

- Models, menus, and textures: Milo, Milo, Milo. MiloExplorer or superfreq
  can both get inside them (though one's a lot better than the other).

- Scripts: The game's scripts are stored in DTB files, which are actually
  tokenized DTA files. DTA stands for Data Array, which is the custom in-
  house language Harmonix wrote the high-level functions of the engine (song
  definitions, menu flow, guitars and finishes, etc.) in. DTA is plain text,
  and once you're used to it, it's a very fun language to write and decode.
  dtab will convert back and forth between the two formats as necessary.

- Audio: Game audio is merely standard PS2 ADPCM files encoded in a weird,
  interleaved format with (generally) 4-6 channels, called VGS. Menu music
  and sound effects are also stored in VGS, though as stereo tracks.
  RockAudio is what you want to build these and to convert them back to
  standard WAV files if needed.

- Charts: Plain ol' MIDI. Get out your favorite MIDI editor, whether that be
  REAPER, Cakewalk, hell, Anvil, I guess? (But also, Anvil sucks.)

TOOLS
=====
For all the old-school tools (most of which are still useful in one capacity
or another), I have an archive on my site, at:

http://mariteaux.somnolescent.net/guitar-hero/

In particular, you'll find FeedBack, good for GH2-specific charting,
RockAudio, the aforementioned audio building tool, and CD/DVD Generator and
Apache3, which are the proper way of making ISOs. Those are just the old
tools though, and the community's been hard at work on a few more now. Fair
warning, a few of these are command-line programs, so make sure you know how
the Command Prompt works before you dive in. Believe me though--worth it.

https://github.com/PikminGuts92/Mackiloha (ArkHelper and superfreq)
https://github.com/mtolly/dtab/ (dtab)
https://github.com/mtolly/onyxite-customs (Onyx Music Game Toolkit, which
can be used to import drums from Rock Band and Clone Hero charts)

With Deluxe 2.0's new loader, you can boot debug off the same disc as the
main game. You'll want to use debug for any modding projects, as you can see
exactly what the game doesn't like when it crashes (90% of the time), which
was basically the only reason Deluxe was possible. 2 Deluxe and Encore Deluxe
use the exact same files, so which one you should pick isn't important. Your
changes will appear in both versions of the game.

TUTORIALS
=========
Documentation is admittedly a little sparse on the ground, but all is not
lost. I've been working on building up a little repository of tutorials for
various modding tasks, anything from opening up an ARK to building separate
audio for Practice. I'm always on the cusp of adding more, so here:

BASIC MODS TO GET YOU STARTED
=============================
But hey, you're probably still lost. Don't worry, this isn't an easy game
to mod and crashes are inevitable. Scott (LocalH) has been at this for over
a decade now; me, seven years and counting. So if you're looking for some
easy, quick starter mods to let you know you're doing this whole modding
and rebuilding the ISO thing correctly, here's some ideas:

CHANGING THE TEXT IN THE GAME:
ui/eng/. This folder contains our split locales. Vanilla GH2 and 1.0 both
contained all the game's strings in a single file, which made editing them
a pain. We've sorted them into named locale files for your convenience.
Change some text in any of the files and see what happens. Unlike other mods,
you thankfully don't need to worry about your game crashing if you make a
"wrong" edit. (Make sure you keep locales encoded as ANSI and not UTF-8, or
else you'll get strange, but otherwise harmless, foreign characters.)

CHANGING SONG NAMES/ARTIST NAMES/PREVIEW TIMES/QUICKPLAY CHARACTERS:
config/songs.dta. One notable exception to the above about locale is song
information. The game stores what VGS and MIDI files it loads, plus the names
of songs, artists, and what guitar, venue, and guitarist is used for
quickplay in another file altogether. Change some song names or something--or
define new songs altogether! Just mind your parentheses--dtab will refuse to
build if you have an extra left or right brace anywhere in your script.

MAKING EASY AND MEDIUM USE THE SAME TRACK SPEED AS HARD/EXPERT:
config/track_graphics.dta. An easy "functional" mod in this file. You can set
the two lower difficulties to run at the same visual speed at Hard and Expert,
which should make them a bit less tedious to play. Look for the track_speed
array a bit down in the file and change the values to whatever you like (even
something ridiculous, if you want). You also get a good look at how bizarre
Data Array arithmetic can look. (Operands come first, like in Lisp.)

ASKING FOR HELP
===============
If you're stuck, or frankly if you just wanna talk to some people up to the
same stuff you seem to have taken an interest in, the MiloHax Discord is
always open. We don't bite. All that much, anyway. If you've got a good sense
of humor, a bit of patience, and a willingness to learn, you'll do just fine.
Here's the invite:

Beyond that, happy modding!
